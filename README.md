This is the main page for Device Agnostic Facial Recognition. [Here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Lx1N-OBXHABskM-tGfDWokGa0WP9ZC0uMf6PZRkDcRg/edit?usp=sharing) is the collection of all helpful recourses.



The facial recognition system is based on a SSD (Single Shot Multibox Detector, a neural network system), which will compute the location of each face in image. The model will return the bounding box of each face, and their probability.
